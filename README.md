# Java BootCamp by [Sigma Software University](https://university.sigma.software/en/) from [Sigma Software Group](https://sigma.software/)

All the stages of the classes are described here, as well as the homework assignments.

The Bootcamp consisted of three phases, so I decided to create three packages (`round_1`, `round_2`, and `round_3`) to match.
Each package contains completed homework assignments with described specifications in `README` files.
These three packages also contain tasks in the increasing complexity of the Bootcamp learning stage.

[Round 1](src/main/java/round_1/README.md) <br>
[Round 2](src/main/java/round_2/README.md) <br>
